What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	
	git creates a .git file and henceforth tracks all changes in the directory.
	In the beginning there are no commits yet. The first is done by the user.
	Without initializing the repository it would not be under version control.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	Unlike the working directory the staging area holds completed parts of work
	that are ready for the repository. Unlike the repository the items in the
	staging area have not been comitted yet. The staging area helps me
	collecting items that are part of a logical unit of work so that I can
	commit them together.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
